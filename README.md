# URL-shortener-website
This HTML file creates a complete, client-side URL shortener using JavaScript and Tailwind CSS. It simulates a backend by saving links to your browser's `localStorage`. The script generates short codes, tracks clicks, handles redirects, and allows you to manage your links, all without a real server.
